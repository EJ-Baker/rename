# rename

This is a command line application designed to rename all of the files inside of a directory. I use it to rename pictures mostly. It can add prefixes and suffixes to files which is useful for tagging photos. It can rename all of the files as ints which is useful when dealing with scanned pictures. It can also randomize the order of files. I use this for slideshows that are being played on smart TVs that donâ€™t support randomizing the picture order.
